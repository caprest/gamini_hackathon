# Agent Workflow Rules

1. Always create changes on a dedicated feature branch.
2. Always open a Pull Request for every feature/fix; do not push direct changes to `main`.
3. Always track `main` as the integration base.
4. Before creating or updating a PR, sync the feature branch with the latest `origin/main`.
5. Resolve conflicts on the feature branch before requesting review.
6. Never create a PR with known merge conflicts.
